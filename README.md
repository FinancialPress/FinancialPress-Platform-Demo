Key Features
Verified "Trust Feed"
A curated news feed designed to filter out unverified content.

Proof of Provenance: All articles are hashed and anchored to the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) via the R3L Protocol, creating an immutable audit trail.

Identity Verification: Contributors undergo tiered verification (from Basic to SEC-compliant KYC) to prevent impersonation and bot activity.

Reputation Engine (RP)
A non-transferable credibility score that quantifies author trustworthiness.

Scoring Logic: Reputation Points (RP) are calculated based on historical accuracy, account longevity, and community validation.

Privileges: Higher RP tiers unlock $FPT rewards, enhanced visibility, and governance participation rights.

Hybrid Monetization
Share-to-Earn: A proprietary attribution engine rewards users with $FPT for distributing verified content that drives genuine engagement.

Micropayments: Integrated Dropp support enables instant fiat (USD) and cryptocurrency (HBAR/USDC) tipping and pay-per-view access.

Technology Stack
FinancialPress leverages a serverless, event-driven architecture to ensure scalability while relying on Hedera for immutable trust.

Core Platform
Web3 & Trust Infrastructure
DevOps & Analytics
Infrastructure: AWS Serverless (Lambda, Fargate, API Gateway).

Analytics: Matomo (Privacy-first user tracking) + CloudWatch (System health).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
