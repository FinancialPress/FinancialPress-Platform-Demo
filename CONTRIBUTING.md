# Contributing to FinancialPress

Thank you for your interest in FinancialPress.

FinancialPress is being built as a credibility-first financial media platform, with long-term plans to open-source key components of our infrastructure, including verification, reputation, and blockchain-adjacent systems.

At this stage, the core platform and underlying architecture are under active development and are not yet open for public code contributions.

## Current Contribution Status

We are not currently accepting pull requests or external code contributions.

This repository exists to:
- Establish project transparency
- Document architectural direction
- Prepare for future open-source releases

As FinancialPress evolves, we plan to open specific modules, SDKs, and tooling for community contribution. When that happens, this file will be updated with clear contribution guidelines, workflows, and code-of-conduct expectations.

## Future Open Source Areas (Planned)

We anticipate open-sourcing components related to:
- Verification and authorship proofs
- Reputation and incentive models
- API interfaces and developer tooling
- Client-side utilities and integrations

These areas are being designed with open collaboration in mind, even if they are not yet publicly available.

## How to Stay Involved

If you are interested in contributing in the future:
- Follow the FinancialPress project on GitHub
- Watch this repository for updates
- Join our official communication channels (to be announced)

We also welcome thoughtful feedback, discussion, and questions via GitHub Issues, where appropriate.

## Licensing

When open-source components are released, they will be licensed under permissive open-source licenses unless otherwise stated. Each repository or module will clearly specify its applicable license.

## Contact

For partnerships, research collaboration, or early technical discussions, please reach out via our official channels or through the FinancialPress website.

Thank you for your interest in helping build more trustworthy financial media.
