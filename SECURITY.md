# Security Policy

FinancialPress takes security and responsible disclosure seriously.

This repository represents an early-stage platform demo and architectural
foundation. The software should not be considered production-ready.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately through our official communication channels or
via the FinancialPress website.

A formal disclosure process and bug bounty program will be published as
open-source components are released.

Thank you for helping us build secure and trustworthy systems.
